# PythonNotebook 
In this repository I just put some interesting experiment with python, tensorflow, keras and more. </br>
The standard form of the code will be a Python Notebook. </br>
In all Notebook I explore some particular useful example of ML algorithms, deep learning, or NLP tasks...

- <b>Different_CNN_architectures_test_Part_I_.ipynb</b>a Shape Detection pipeline comparing different CNNs (AlexNet, VGG, ResNet and DenseNet) on a toy dataset of synthetic images. 
- <b>CS231n - Toy Experiment.ipynb</b>: Some experiments that compares Nearest Neighbour, Softmax, LinearSVM and Two Layer Neural Network.
- <b>Codility_Games.ipynb</b>: Codility is a tech recruiting platform, with a series of online code testing. When I have time for a diversion and want to do a 'crossword puzzle' I solve one of their tests.
- <b>Generative model with n-grams</b>: the character-level maximum-likelihood langauge models by Yoav Goldberg applied to some italian writers books ('Lo Zibaldone' by Giacomo Leopardi and 'I promessi sposi' by Alessandro Manzoni).
- <b>Just a simple Chatbot</b>: A rudimentary chatbot created with Starspace for the HSE Natural Language Process course honor project.
- <b>Learn_to_use_RNN_with_tensorflow</b>: Some simple steps to understand the power of TensorFlow and its ability to synthesize.
- <b>P2_Chatbot__</b>: A more complex chatbot created with an encoder/decoder architecture. A sequence to sequence model that use RNN layers and GRU cells. 
- <b>Shape_Detection</b>: A good toy algorithm that create a trainingset for developing bounding boxes for identification of objects in images. 
- <b>Tokenization and normalization</b>: the use of tokenization and normalization functions to get familiar with the python NLTK module.
