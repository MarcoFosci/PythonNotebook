# PythonNotebook 
In this repository I just put some interesting experiment with python, tensorflow, keras and more. </br>
The standard form of the code will be a Python Notebook. </br>
In all Notebook I explore some particular useful example of ML algorithms, deep learning, or NLP tasks...

- <b>Generative model with n-grams</b>: the character-level maximum-likelihood langauge models by Yoav Goldberg applied to some italian writers books ('Lo Zibaldone' by Giacomo Leopardi and 'I promessi sposi' by Alessandro Manzoni)
- <b>Tokenization and normalization</b>: the use of tokenization and normalization functions to get familiar with the python NLTK module
- <b>Learn_to_use_RNN_with_tensorflow</b>: Some simple steps to understand the power of TensorFlow and its ability to synthesize
- <b>Just a simple Chatbot</b>: A rudimentary chatbot created with Starspace for the HSE Natural Language Process course honor project
